Think mystic planets, alien terrains, light portals and floating through atmosphere‚Äîwith a pair of shades that hit different. What starts as a film slowly reveals itself as a product ad. A subtle buildup to a visual punchline.\n\nEverything you see was crafted by hand:\nFrom hard surface modeling the glasses (every screw and hinge), to designing a transparent Dior-inspired jacket in Marvelous Designer, to environment sculpting, procedural textures, and character detailing in Mari. Lighting, compositing and grade were done in NukeX and DaVinci Resolve.\n\nNo AI, no heavy character animation‚Äîjust storytelling through design, camera, and atmosphere.\n\n///// Full reel here: https://youtu.be/tunbBRwcwJc?si=zFD96G8AnUM-onWz /////\n\n///// Full Breakdown here: https://youtu.be/cwNPcSd2RLY?si=mbzSxCsewNkT1iTb /////\n\nI‚Äôd love to get your feedback‚Äîwhat worked, what didn‚Äôt, what you'd push further?\nIf you‚Äôre into projects where concept and craft go hand in hand, I‚Äôd love to connect.\n\nThanks for watching‚Äîand now that the reel's out, I'm off to recharge and catch some waves in Indonesia.

Furthermore, I am experienced in many styles of editing such as **retention/ faced-paced editing** or **story-driven editing**. I am really wanting to work with someone with a **great work ethic** and videos that are good but where I am able to improve upon with my own details. As well as long-form videos of around 10 - 40 minutes (my speciality), I can also create short-form videos for **Youtube**, **Tik Tok** and **Instagram**. If you have a specific style of editing that I did not mention already or that you'd rather me replicate please let me know by sending an example of a Youtuber that you may want it to be like, it would be really helpful because I want to make sure that I've learnt how they've edited they're videos in every way and why it's unique to them! I want to work **long-term** with someone so if you're interested, leave a message in the **comments**.\n\n- Price will depend on the raw footage length and how dense you want the edits to be, but they are very reasonable and always negotiable. Usually **¬£70 to ¬£150** for longform (We can discuss more in DM's) \n\n- We can communitcate via **Whatsapp or Discord**.\n\n- To share the footage I mainly use **Google Drive**.\n\n- Payment is by **PAYPAL ONLY**.\n\nRegards.\n\nPortfolio: https://ytjobs.co/@crimson"
